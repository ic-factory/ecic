* Remove any '/' prefix and postfix from library names when generating a new library (to allow use of "find" command to generate a number of libraries)
* 'addfile' command must check that each add file actually exists.

#Syntax for sources.rb

add design   chip, :env => ['asic_rtl', 'asic_gate', 'fpga_rtl']
add design   [basic_vhdl, chip], :except => {:env => ['asic']}
#add design chip_tb, :path => '/some/absolute/path'
#add testbench chip_tb, :path => '/some/absolute/path'

#Libraries can be added in libraries.rb with the syntax:
  library.create('lib_x')
